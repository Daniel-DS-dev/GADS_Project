# LAB:Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

### Objectives
* Initialize App Engine.

* Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

* Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

* Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.


1. Initialize App Engine

    * Initialize your app engine with your project name and set the region where $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID is your project ID

        gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

    * A prompt will show asking you to choose a region among all the listed region. 14 is for us-central1

        14
    
    * The appengine will be created in the region you set
    * Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

    * Navigate to the source directory

        cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2. Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell (Hello world App)
* We will run the Hello World App in a local, virtual environment in Cloud shell.

    * Download and update the packages list

        sudo apt-get update
    
    * Set up a virtual environment where you will run your application

        sudo apt-get install virtualenv

    * A prompt will show, and you will select Y and press Enter

    * Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.

        virtualenv -p python3 venv

    * Activate the virtual environment

        source venv/bin/activate

    * Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

        pip install  -r requirements.txt

    * Run the application

        python main.py

3. Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it

    * Navigate to the source directory:

        cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

    * Deploy your Hello World Application

        gcloud app deploy
    
    * If prompted, press Y

    * Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

        gcloud app browse

    * And that is it, you have deployed your app engine.

4. Disable the application

    * To disable the application go to cloud console,  click app engine  then settings then click disable application.
