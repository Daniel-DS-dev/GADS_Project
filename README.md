# Popoola Daniel's GADS Practise Project
# ------------------------------------------------------------


## I completed 11 Hands-on labs on Qwiklabs, I have uploaded proofs of completion through screenshot of emails received and I have saved them in the 
## folder named "GADS Practise Project/Screenshots".
# 

## The labs and there objectives are:

## From the Associate Cloud Engineer: Learning Phase 1 Main Track Channel (2020):

    * Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
    * Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.
    
### 2. Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine
  #### Objectives:
    * Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
    * Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
    * Connect between the two instances.
    
### 3. Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Cloud Marketplace
  #### Objectives:
    * Launching a solution using Cloud Marketplace
    

### 4. Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE
  #### Objectives:
    * Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.
    * Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.

### 5. HTTP Load Balancer with AutoScaling
  #### Objectives:
    * Create a health check firewall rule
    * Create a NAT configuration using Cloud Router
    * Create a custom image for a web server
    * Create an instance template based on the custom image
    * Create two managed instance groups
    * Configure an HTTP load balancer with IPv4 and IPv6
    * Stress test an HTTP load balancer

### 6. Virtual Private Networks(VPN)
  #### Objectives:
    * Create VPN gateways in each network
    * Create VPN tunnels between the gateways
    * Verify VPN connectivity

## From the Phase 1 Deepdive Channel:
### 7. AK8S-04 Creating a GKE Cluster via Cloud Shell
  #### Objectives:
    * Use kubectl to build and manipulate GKE clusters
    * Use kubectl and configuration files to deploy Pods
    * Use Container Registry to store and deploy containers

## From the Phase 2 Maintrack Channel:
### 8. Classify Images with Pre-built ML Models using Cloud Vision API and AutoML
  #### Objectives:
    *Upload a labeled dataset to Google Cloud Storage and connect it to AutoML Vision with a CSV label file.
    * Train a model with AutoML Vision and evaluate its accuracy.
    * Generate predictions on your trained model.
  
### 9. Create a Streaming Data Pipeline for a Real-Time Dashboard with Cloud Dataflow
  #### Objectives:
    * You will build a streaming data pipeline to capture taxi revenue, passenger count, ride status, and much more and 
    visualize the results in a management dashboard.
    * Create a Cloud Pub/Sub Topic
    * Create a BigQuery dataset
    * Create a Cloud Storage Bucket
    * Set up a Cloud Dataflow Pipeline
    * Analyze the Taxi Data Using BigQuery
    * Perform aggregations on the stream for reporting
    * Create a Real-Time Dashboard
  
  
### 10. Predict Visitor Purchases with a Classification Model with BigQuery ML
  #### Objectives:
    * Use BigQuery to find public datasets
    * Query and explore the ecommerce dataset
    * Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction
    * Create a classification (logistic regression) model in BQML
    * Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model
    * Predict and rank the probability that a visitor will make a purchase
  
### 11. Recommend Products using ML with Cloud SQL and Dataproc
  #### Objectives:
    * Create Cloud SQL instance
    * Create tables
