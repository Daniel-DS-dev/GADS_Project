# Popoola Daniel's GADS Practise Project
# Google Cloud Practise project
## The cloud challenge is divided into 2 parts:

## For the first challenge, I completed 12 Hands-on labs on Qwiklabs, I have uploaded proof of completion of each and saved them in the folder "GADS Practise Project/Screenshots".
# 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## For the second challenge, I translated 2 labs from console instructions to 100% command line instructions, and I saved them inside the folder "GADS Practise Project/Translations" 

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The labs I completed and their objectives are:

## From the Associate Cloud Engineer: Learning Phase 1 Main Track Channel (2020):

## From the Phase 2 Maintrack Channel:
### 8. Classify Images with Pre-built ML Models using Cloud Vision API and AutoML
  #### Objectives:
    *Upload a labeled dataset to Google Cloud Storage and connect it to AutoML Vision with a CSV label file.
    * Train a model with AutoML Vision and evaluate its accuracy.
    * Generate predictions on your trained model.
  
### 9. Create a Streaming Data Pipeline for a Real-Time Dashboard with Cloud Dataflow
  #### Objectives:
    * You will build a streaming data pipeline to capture taxi revenue, passenger count, ride status, and much more and 
    visualize the results in a management dashboard.
    * Create a Cloud Pub/Sub Topic
    * Create a BigQuery dataset
    * Create a Cloud Storage Bucket
    * Set up a Cloud Dataflow Pipeline
    * Analyze the Taxi Data Using BigQuery

    * Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model
    * Predict and rank the probability that a visitor will make a purchase
  
### 11. Recommend Products using ML with Cloud SQL and Dataproc
  #### Objectives:
    * Create Cloud SQL instance
    * Create tables
    * Stage Data in Google Cloud Storage
